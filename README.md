# MING (MQTT, InfluxDB, N3uron, Grafana)

The MING stack is a popular combination of open-source technologies used for building scalable and real-time Industrial Industrial IoT data processing and visualization systems.

* MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks, commonly used for IoT applications.
* InfluxDB is a scalable, high-performance, distributed, and fault-tolerant time-series database that is optimized for storing and querying large volumes of timestamped data.
* N3uron is an Industrial Edge Platform for DataOps that streamlines the flow of data between industrial devices and business applications, either on-premise or in the cloud.
* Grafana is an open-source platform for data visualization and monitoring that allows users to create, explore, and share dashboards and alerts for a wide range of data sources, including databases, APIs, and metrics.
